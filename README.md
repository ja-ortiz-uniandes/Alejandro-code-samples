# Alejandro Ortiz Code samples & projects! <!-- omit in toc --> 

Thank you for visiting the repo for my code samples and projects!

For each project, it's recommended to look at the associated report first before looking at the actual script or markdown file.

## What's in this repo <!-- omit in toc --> 

This repo is in V 0.8. This is the first version with a fully deployed project. Over time, this repo will continue to grow with the inclusion of new projects and the sophistication of existing ones. I have many interesting ideas I am eager to make a reality, but if you are looking for any particular use case or language feel free to contact me!

This README file is structured as follows:

## Git in this project
### Branching strategy
It is always worth recognizing that different branching strategies have different advantages and disadvantages. Most branching strategies focus on the way teams collaborate. Because the nature of this repo is that it is mostly a collection of solo projects, some of the nuances between branching strategies get lost. With that said, here you will see a strategy most similar to *GitHub flow*. However, as mentioned before, this is a solo project and as such there are no pull requests. What this means in practice, is that there is a branch for every project which is then merged directly into `main`. It is worth noting, however, that only branches with completed projects are pushed to this remote.

The main idea behind this branching strategy is to maintain a lightweight, easy to understand, record of changes made. When working with a team this is valuable because it improves communication and simplifies merging (always valuable). In this context this branching strategy is valuable as it helps you, the reader, to easily locate individual projects. In turn, this helps to make the entire development process more transparent and easier to understand.

### Signing commits
You will also notice that all commits in this repo (except for some of the very early ones) are signed and verified. This is meant to demonstrate knowledge of GPG encryption.
