# Alejandro Ortiz Code samples & projects! <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for visiting the repo for my code samples and projects!

This repository contains selected code samples and research projects.
Most projects have code and an accompanying report. It is recommended to consult the report first, as it provides context, methodology, and interpretation of results.

## What's in this repo <!-- omit in toc -->

This repository (v0.8) represents the first release with a fully deployed project. Future updates will expand both the number of projects and the methodological scope, including more advanced econometric, statistical, and machine learning applications.

## Git in this project

### Branching strategy

It is worth recognizing that different branching strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages, most of which relate to team collaboration. Since this repository primarily contains individual projects, many of those collaborative aspects are less relevant. Here, the approach is most similar to a _project-branch workflow_ on a stable `main`: only branches corresponding to completed projects are pushed to the remote repository.

### Commit Signing

All commits (except early versions) are signed and verified using GPG encryption. This ensures authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility, important practices in both software engineering and academic research.
