abstract: |
 First paragraph of what may be the best abstract ever written. It is a
 beautiful abstract because nobody writes abstracts better than I do.

 Second paragraph of the abstract continues to be just magnificent. It is 
 simply because I'm a very stable genius. OK, SERIOUS NOW: HTML code can be
 also added to leave some breating space after abstract such as <br><br><br>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
