 Thank you for looking at my simulation code sample in `R`! This is a report for a project I thought of while doing a questionnaire for the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME). The question was: "*There is a program that is implemented at the village level. Households within the same village are very similar but households between villages are not. To maximize the likelihood of detecting the programs effect is it better to sample more households within each village or to sample more villages?*"

In this directory you will find a fully replicable and portable project in R that uses simulation techniques to answer this question. I decided to do this project as I believe is a good demonstration of my skills in `R`. It covers function writing, data management, visualization, parallelization, memory usage, error handling, local vs. global variables, planning for edge cases, use of many different data types from vectors to data.tables through matrices and lists; and brings it all together using a real-world question about sampling techniques. It demonstrates the use of many different and popular packages like `tidyverse`, `data.table`, `furrr`, and `plotly`. Lastly, this report itself shows the use of Rmarkdown with HTML, CSS, and YAML elements mixed in.

However, it's worth saying that this is only a sample of my abilities in R. **If there is any particular demonstration you would like to see, please feel free contact me**.
